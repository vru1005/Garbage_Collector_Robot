# Garbage Collector Boat 

The **Water Trash Cleaner** is a robotic system designed to clean the surface of rivers and other water bodies by collecting floating waste and pollutants. This project uses an Arduino-based system, featuring a conveyor belt mechanism for trash collection, a weight sensor for real-time waste measurement, and a 4-channel remote control for navigation.

## üìù Overview

- **Remote Control**: Navigate the boat using a 4CH radio transmitter and receiver.
- **Trash Collection**: A conveyor belt picks up floating waste and deposits it into a collection bin.
- **Real-Time Data Display**: An integrated weight sensor measures and displays the weight of collected trash on an LCD.
- **Cost-Effective and Scalable**: Built with readily available components, ensuring affordability and scalability.
